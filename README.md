# Project Discription
In the desert area, Sand get accumulates on the panels, 
which decreases the efficiency. We made an automatic wiper 
with the help of Arduino Uno, an IR Sensor and Servo 
motors, which cleans the panel when it detects that sand is 
accumulated. 

# Tools Used
Arduino UNO, IR Sensor, Servo Motors
